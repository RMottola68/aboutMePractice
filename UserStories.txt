1) As a livestreamer, I want media requests to be automatically 
marked or deleted to avoid breaking my platform's terms of service.

2) As a content creator, I'd like my videos to be labeled as "TOS" so 
livestreamers can view them without worrying about bans.

3) As a viewer, I'd like the media that I request to be marked as abiding 
by a streaming platform's terms of service, so that my favorite content
creators aren't afraid of being banned.
