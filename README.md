Hello, my name's Ryan Mottola.

The name of my theoretical app is "Stream Censor"

A streamer can only wear so many hats, and a mod can only watch chat for so many hours. Let Stream Censor mod your media. 

An automated solution for livestreamers on twitch / youtube / facebook to filter their incoming media requests. 

Requested media will be marked preemptively with increasing levels of offense, the lowest level being the safest / most family friendly. 

This is an effort to prevent streamers from breaking terms of service, thus, being banned. 

Once the user logs into their preferred platform on the stream censor website, they can choose the rigidity of of their censor as well as add / updated videos that require censorship. 

In a perfect world, I could enable allow users to login to said platforms and integrate an app like this into their preferred streaming software, but we haven't quite reached that section of the bootcamp. It's mostly login verification, I believe.
