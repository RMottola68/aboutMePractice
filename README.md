Theoretical Media Censor App

A streamer can only wear so many hats, and a mod can only watch chat for so many hours. Let Media Censor mod your media. 

An automated solution for livestreamers on twitch / youtube / facebook to filter their incoming media requests. 

Requested media will be marked preemptively with increasing levels of offense, the lowest level being the safest / most family friendly. 

This is an effort to prevent streamers from breaking terms of service, thus, being banned.
