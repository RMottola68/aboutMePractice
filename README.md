Hello, my name's Ryan Mottola.

The name of my theoretical app/ business is "Stream Censor"

I used HTML, CSS, and Javascript for this project.

A streamer can only wear so many hats, and a moderators can only watch chat for so many hours. Let Stream Censor mod your media. 

An automated solution for livestreamers on twitch, facebook, and youtube to filter their incoming media requests. 

Requested media will be marked preemptively with increasing levels of offense, the lowest level being the most family friendly, and the highest setting being completely against terms of service.

This is an effort to prevent streamers from breaking terms of service, thus, being banned. 

Once the user logs into their preferred platform on the stream censor website, they can choose the rigidity of their censor as well as add videos that require censorship. 

Improvements: In a perfect world, I could allow users to login to said platforms and integrate an app like this into their preferred streaming software, but we haven't quite reached that section of the bootcamp. It's mostly login verification, I believe. 

Having an understanding of databases and SQL would be massively important to a project like this, so I'm looking forward to covering those sections. 

I used the div element too easily, thinking that it was convenient to transform and manipulate. Because it's such a vague tag, I think it's important to use more semantic elements in my code.
